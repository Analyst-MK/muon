## Muon file manager

Muon is a powerful and lightweight open source PHP/JavaScript-based file manager for your web space released under the MIT license.

## Features
- *You don't need to install any boring app to manage your web space*: Muon works as a web-app and its simple, fast loading and responsive interface is optimized for modern browsers for desktops, tablets and smartphones;
- *A stand-alone 94kB file*: Muon's code is compressed in a single 94kB page and it's ready to work out-of-the-box. No external resources are used (not even fonts or pictures);
- *No database required*: Muon allows a single user access, so a database would be a useless waste of resources. All settings are stored at the beginning of the file, and (of course) hidden to visitors;
- Fully open source - released under the MIT License.
