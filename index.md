### Manage your website from the browser

*You don't need to install any boring app to manage your web space!*

Muon works as a web-app and its simple, fast loading and responsive interface is optimized for modern browsers for desktops, tablets and smartphones.


### Everything you need

*What else should a file manager do?*

- **Browse** folders, display sizes, permission and tree structure.
- **Move, copy, delete, rename** your files and **create new ones**.
- **Zip/unzip** archives â€” this requires PHP-Zip extension on your server.
- **Upload** multiple files, according to server's limitations.
- **Built-in text editor**; yeah, Muon can edit text files too! This tool is one of the most helpful to manage your site's pages (HTML, PHP), scripts (JS) and stylesheets (CSS).

### No database required

*One user & one password!*

Muon allows a single user access, so a database would be a useless waste of resources. All settings are stored at the beginning of the file, and (of course) hidden to visitors.


### A stand-alone 94kB file

*Just one file, nothing more!*

Muon's code is compressed in a single 94kB page (*muon.php*) and it's ready to work out-of-the-box. No external resources are used (not even fonts or pictures)!
